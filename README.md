# Discord-Grabber
It's a simple tool I created that grabs IP and system information and sends it using Discord webhooks.
Don't forget to join my [Discord server!](https://discord.com/invite/fEqXe2CceZ).

## Infomation
This program retrieves the target's IP, IPv6, system information, memory information, and CPU information.

## Usage
Run this command in CMD, terminal or PowerShell (if you don't already have the following modules installed):
```
pip install psutil
pip install requests
```
1. Create a discord webhook.
2. Replace "webhook-url-here" with your webhooks url, make sure its discord.com instead of discordapp.com.
3. (Optional) Compile the file into a exe, dont know how? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZX5kH72Yx4.
4. Done.

This is illegal if you use this without the consent of the owners (in this case, the Discord team). I am not accountable for anything you might get into. This is 100% educational; please do not misuse this tool.
